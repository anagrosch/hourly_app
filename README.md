# Hourly

This application times how long you work for in one sitting and saves the total number of hours worked each day.
A summary of the number of hours worked for each job of the current week and the corresponding wages earned is
available in the TOTAL HOURS page.

### Usage

Add jobs with the ADD JOB button. Each job requires a job title to be displayed as a button and its hourly wage.
Delete a button by pressing and holding the job button.

Pressing a job's button transfers you to its timer for when you are working that job.

To see your total hours for the week, press the TOTAL HOURS button. If tracking multiple jobs, swipe left to see
each job's week total. Tracked hours are rounded to the nearest value (i.e. 1.2 hours -> 1 hour, 1.6 hours -> 2
hours).

The total week hours are automatically reset every Sunday at midnight. You can manually clear the week's hours by
pressing the RESET HOURS button, if desired.

### Requirements
